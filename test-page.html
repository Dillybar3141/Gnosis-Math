        Integral Domain
    </h1>
    <p>
        An <i>integral domain</i> is a <a>cancellative</a> <a>commutative</a> <a>ring</a>.
        $$
            \int_a^b f(x)\, dx = F(b) - F(a)
        $$
        The main motivation for defining a topological space is to have a space where both continuity and convergence can be defined.

A topological space also allows for the distinction between open and closed sets, which in turn permits the definition of the closure, interior, boundary, and exterior of arbitrary sets.

Two topological spaces may be considered equivalent if they are homeomorphic, meaning there is a homeomorphism (a bijective continuous map whose inverse is also continuous) between them.
        $$
            \operatorname {Alt} \colon {\bigotimes }^{k}T^{*}M\to {\bigotimes }^{k}T^{*}M
        $$
Topological spaces form a category, called <b>Top</b>, with continuous maps as morphisms. Homeomorphisms are isomorphisms in the category of topological spaces.
